# Mitiq Tutorial

Welcome to the Mitiq tutorial for IEEE's annual quantum week!
Thanks for coming.
This README details how to get set up to follow along live during the tutorial.
If you do find yourself stuck at any point during the set up, speak up so we can help you get the issue resolved!

## Setup

There are two main ways for getting set up that we recommend to follow along live for this tutorial.

1. Clone this repo and install the necessary dependencies manually. See ["Locally"](#locally) section below.
2. Use GitHub codespaces to avoid setting up a new environment. This will require a GitHub account.

Of course, you are welcome to set up in any other way you'd like if you feel more comfortable with another method.

### Locally

To get set up locally, you'll need to

1. `git clone` this repo
2. [Optional, but recommended] Set up a new virtual environment to ensure no dependency conflicts.
3. Install the necessary dependencies `pip install mitiq`
4. Load up the jupyter notebook for [part 1](./part1.ipynb)

### Remotely

To follow along on your own computer, without installing anything locally, navigate to https://github.com/unitaryfund/mitiq-tutorial/.

1. Via the green "Code" button, select the "Codespaces" tab.
2. Click the button that says "Create codespace on main".
